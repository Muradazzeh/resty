# Component Based UI

* ### this is the link for netlify [netlify link](https://amazing-raindrop-71f627.netlify.app/)

* I prepared UML diagram for the starter code as shown below :

## Lab Requirements
* Refactor the RESTy application as follows:

* [x] Convert all child components of App.js from classes to functions
* [x] The App component serves as the container for all sub-components of this application.
   Leave this component as a Class.
* [x] Make sure all base styles for App are included in a .scss imported within App.js.
* [x] Ensure that the Header, Footer, Results and Form components are imported using ES6 import syntax.
* [x] Use .scss files to style each component
  Each of the components use their own .scss file for styling.
* [x] Core application functionality should remain unchanged:
The <Form> component should:
Call a function on submit that updates the <App/> component via a function sent down as a prop so that the app can process the form values.
The <Results/> component should show mock API results.

* After arranging file as requirement this is the task tree

* I kept the app.js as class component as they required in the lap
